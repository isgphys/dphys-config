Description: Tool to distribute config files
 This project is aimed at installing (and keeping update) the site specific
 config files we want, after preprocessing them (conditional content and
 include files and include sections). It also triggers postinstall scripts
 whenever their associated config file has been changed. It can also remove
 config files, including running an preremove script before doing so. All
 this is driven by an simple config file list.
