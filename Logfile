background is the dphys-admin project, read its Logfile at:
  http://nic.phys.ethz.ch/projects/dphys-admin/Logfile
as part of that wrote this tool to do auto-loading of config for packages
  here only log of the events pertaining to making this tool

2005.04.28 Thu
looking at dphys-admin example config and dphys-local-admin generated config
  note that dphys-local-admin also sets /etc/default/dphys, also needs change
    only contains url-path for accessing config files on config server
    heeb discussion about /etc/default/dphys and what packages use it
      according to new policy all dphys-setup-* use local files, no net access
    only dphys-local-* fetches stuff from server, used by older packages
      has led to proliferation of dphys-local-* packages, work, duplicate code
    heeb uses dphys-common-tools lib now, common code, has url-path hardcoded
  bring up suggestion of single downloader, dphys-config, with url-path in it
    on server then file with list file-on-server:path-on-target:script-to-run
  will require per-package config files, no splitting/processing
    is cleaner, but means that keyboard needs setting twice (X and console)
  split out /etc/default/dphys to separate dphys-local-etc-default-dphys
    to be left there, so long still old-style packages use it
    add that to top of /pub/debian-local/share/main.pkglist to be safe
senguen discuss paths for config files
  we will use http://server/configs/sarge/<hostname>/<conffile>
    which will then be /pub/debian-local/configs/sarge/<hostname>/<conffile>

2005.04.29 Fri
forked dphys-config project off from dphys-admin
  while starting up that removed 3.0 remark from README
make dphys-config so it will work on woody and sarge, so path version depend
  no file contains "woody" or "sarge", only /etc/debian_version "3.0" or "3.1"
  so path http://server/configs/`cat /etc/debian_version`/<hostname>/<file>
    and with http://server/configs/sarge/<hostname>/<conffile> comfort symlink
makesourcepackage generated project directory
  Makefile new title line, README adapted from dphys-admin, Logfile started

2005.05.12 Thu
further generating project, FAQ, INSTALL
sketched out what features need to go in

2005.05.13 Fri
further generating project, index.html.*, makefile make tar
dphys-config.example setting CONF_BASEURL for server and subdir
  needed to read configs, so not settable by dphys-config
    so set it by dphys[2|3] end[firstrun|2ndstage] by writing into file
  this also solves the `cat /etc/debian_version` problem
    dphys[2|3] dependant [woody|sarge] string in above action
started coding dphys-config
  all sh script boilerplate taken from makesourcepackage (dphys-admin is perl)
    while at it more code unification, added stuff missing in some places
  download list of config files to process, file tests copied from dphys-admin
    test runs download, wget of 404 files faills to give error message

2005.05.19 Thu
further coding dphys-config, missing wget error message was missing "!"
  made /pub/debian-local/configs/woody/pomfrey/conf_list dir and test conf_list
    despite 1 line loops runs twice, 1st for conffile, 2nd for place
  is because -d sets line end, not field separator
    using IFS= fails with syntax error, use cut, this works
  allow $SCRIPT to be a full command with parameters, strip for some stuff
  allow commented out lines and empty lines in config files list
  made an cron.d script and started init.d script
  how pass cron/init.d to dphys-admin? not at all, own scripts for such cases
    same for special stuff like dphys-admin, own init.d and cron.d for timing

2005.05.20 Fri
dphys-config finished init.d script, run early before daemons
search all dphys-local-* packages for functions they do
  decide what to offer in dphys-config, and what to expect in scripts
  dphys-local-admin: generate /etc/dphys-admin
    URL base (now superfluous as we load), and email adress -> get 2 files
  dphys-local-afs: get /etc/openafs/CellServDB file from server
    generate /etc/default/afs.conf from config vars -> get a file
  dphys-local-anacronconf: generate /etc/cron.d/anacron to start anacron
    -> file, with randomised time already in it
  dphys-local-aptconf: generate /etc/apt/sources.list -> get file (or files)
  dphys-local-auth: get /etc/ssh/* and chown/chmod, inst /etc/pam.d/* files
    generate /etc/pam_ldap.conf with config var in it, host in group
    generate /etc/cron.allow from NIS -> all get files (host specific)
  dphys-local-autofs: generate auto.master and restart /etc/init.d/autofs
    -> files and trigger script (or direct restart command)
  dphys-local-console-keymap: get config, run /usr/sbin/install-keymap
    -> leave or install an file and run script
  dphys-local-debconf: just set critical and noninteractive -> done already
  dphys-local-devfsconf: generate /etc/devfs/compat_symlinks -> get file
    and we are dropping devfs -> so no need anyway
  dphys-local-dhclient: generate /etc/dhclient.conf -> get file
  after 10 scripts it seems, copy+script is enough
    worst case make an (reduced) package with just special actions
man page dphys-config.8, from dhys-admin, but as sh also from dphys-pkgtools
  while doing this noticed inconsistent terminology and missing functions
    main->common (better to read) and conf_list->dphys-config (more obvious)
    config files may need paths making (else error and not there)
    if file installed under same name (usual) dont require duplicate typing
    have an option for removing config files not needed any more

2005.05.26 Thu
for better user visible naming changes:
  main->common, pre|post->hostpre|hostpost, conf_list->dphys-config.list
make directory for new config files
for place path ending in / add file name, save user typing
  while man page added example where full name needed, same name, diff dir
added for debugging an directory base, so can test in /tmp/.../<stuff>
  test runs, fixes, OK
improved man page wording and formatting, pass to senguen to check over

2005.05.27 Fri
on pomfrey make /etc/dphys-config config file, as no dphys-local-config wanted
package version 20050527.122702-1, changelog:
  "initial release"
fails to install /usr/sbin/dphys-config
  was Makefile, still had # in each line, from when generating
intro to senguen, how to use it, explained exact site layput, ideas
  make /pub/debian-local/configs/woody/`hostname` directories for all
  added symlinks to ../SITE/dphys-config.list
  made empty (only comments) SITE/dphys-config.list file
  all hosts made /etc/dphys-config file with server location
  existing dphys-admin pkglist file added dphys-config so it gets installed
with senguen ported some dphys-local-* packages, see how it performs
  noticed good thing to oder some files into directories under SITE
    can copy by dir/file syntax, but in /tmp/dphys-config-*/ needs mkdir -p
  files wgetted have current time, lose edit time, tried -N, same, leave it
  if command is multiple separated by ; shell fails to split them, use eval

2005.06.09 Thu
fixed debian/dphys-config.init, removed unneccessary and effectless parameter
  was still /usr/sbin/dphys-config init, from editing old dphys-admin script
if no scripts found, not just warning, also don't run missing script
improved error messages, log fatal and warning, for when running cron/init.d
packaged version 20050609.173645-1, changelog:
  "fix init.d, no script don't run, improve err msg, syslog fatal/warning"

2005.06.10 Fri
on system install with config before admin, using scripts only fetched by admin
  gives time dependency, admin packages need config, so must be this way
    config already doesn't run script, and then gives warning, ignore it
      user can avoid warning if using /bin/sh -c "if [ ... ] ; then ... ; fi"
    then admin fetched packages must run script on install (postinst/init.d)
      if it finds an preexisiting (non-purge remove or config) file there
  document this behaviour and solution in man page
packaged version 20050610.134347-1, changelog:
  "improved man page, gotchas, dphys-config vs dphys-admin install time"

2005.06.16 Thu
problem with wget -N and -O options clashing, -N not really usefull, remove it
packaged version 20050616.130021-1, changelog:
  "bugfix wget without -N, some verbose output now as info"
senguen request optimise output, -v all, no -v installing/script, -q nothing
made wget retry each file 3 times, and put out error if not finding server
  at present we have with 150 hosts and 30 files up to 5 faillures every night
packaged version 20050616.152551-1, changelog:
  "changed cron.d time to avoid 04:00 net reconfig troubles"

2005.06.17 Fri
above wget 3 times also fails, now explicit loop, call 3 times and evaluate
  only return on 200 or 404 status, everything else log and abort
packaged version 20050617.130219-1, changelog:
  "bugfix config overwrite partial with files when DNS sporadic fails"
spread load of 150 systems over an hour like dphys-admin
  call with none|"none"|"cron"|"init" mode, on cron delay by rand
file permissions of installed files, man page document chown/chmod usage
packaged version 20050617.142523-1, changelog:
  "randomised cron run times to spread load, man documented chown/chmod"

2005.06.30 Thu
senguen no // in path, fixed generating CONFPLACE
packaged version 20050630.105838-1, changelog:
  "fixed // in install paths"

2005.07.01 Fri
also handle large files, such as entire kernel.tar.gz files
  so keep all downloaded "temporary" files, for wget -N, permanent work dir
  no delete of temp dir at end, so move from /tmp to /var/cache
  wget no -O, so use (cd ; wget), so no file renaming, no .common, use .merged
test run, works in /tmp/dphys-config.debug, but pam.d/* screwed
  is missing -O which contained pam.d/, dir needs to go into cd
handle chown/chmod problems, now that temporary files are permanent
packaged version 20050701.155459-1, changelog:
  "handle large files, only fetch once, unless file changed"

2005.07.07 Fri
corrected some outdated comments

2005.09.08 Thu
all scripts added  exit 0  at end, following new policy
makefile install .example
man page document options -q -v -D -h
set INSTALL <date>=  to  ????????  (= none yet)
packaged version 20050708.144751-1, changelog:
  "fix for sarge chown/chmod -f bug"

2005.09.15 Thu
improved man page gotchas section wording

2005.09.23 Fri
on booting errors, because can not access config files server
  is because identd is only started by inetd with is rc2.d/S20, we have S18
  delay execution until after S20, will need restarting updated S20 daemons
    needs to run before dphys-admin (S24), so run as S22, changed debian/*.init
packaged version 20050923.171624-1, changelog:
  "bugfix rc2.d/S?? runlevel, after S20 of inetd and identd"

2005.09.29 Thu
still failed, works on newly installed, but not on updated preexisting
  is fault of update-rc.d, does no install if existing link, no remove old
  fix this by doing an  mv  by hand, als all new machines work right

2005.10.13 Thu
extended man page with more examples, loading scripts, improved wording
  also suggested method for making/copying an new host
packaged version 20051013.151800-1, changelog:
  "improved man page, describe scripts and host copying"

2005.12.22 Thu
changed CMD_* stuff to same new system as in dphys3

2006.06.29 Thu
fixed -D bug, shift 1 after the  if DEBUG_$1  tests, as in dphys3 and msp
added  set -e  after config stuff, as now in all other scripts
  add robustness against non-0 return values,  || /bin/true  in some places
added debug output of exit value of called scripts
  systematic command|script -> command naming for triggerable command
  chmod/chown of temp config files only if script run, else never reason

2006.06.30 Fri
added support for uninstalling outdated config files
  run the facultative script as pre uninstall instead of post install
  yes, we are now up to the full abilities of Debian package install/remove
    just here for single non-packaged config files, and list file driven
    and with host specific assembly of each file from 3 parts pre/all/post
  when uninstalling only remove the target file
    its temporary files can not be located for sure, leave them in /var/cache
when testing erroneous line with : at beginning, does nonsense
  should issue an error message and abort, same if no : or nothing after
  same also if no config file part could be retrieved, file(s) missing
    but allow any of the 3 parts to be missing, inkl the main/site one
man page updated to reflect uninstall ability, added more examples
packaged version 20060630.155509-1, changelog:
  "added ability to remove config files, with pre uninstall commands"

2006.07.02 Sun
problem with recursive dpkg call hanging after update
  was because dphys-admin -> apt-get update -> dpkg -> dphys-config postinst
    -> init.d -> dphys-config init -> dphys-scripts -> dpkg (recursive)
  problem is using dpkg in dphys-scripts, instead of using dphys-admin `` stuff
    actually dphys-scripts itsself is a violation of dphys-config idea
    from dphys-config should not run stuff that changes dpkg (u/i/r/p) state
  while looking at this switched off debugging output which was left on
packaged version 20060702.003332-1, changelog:
  "bugfix switched off debugging which was left enabled"

2006.07.27 Thu
correct site and host directory tests, so it aborts if not there
for command return value != 0 output and log an note
added {} syntax to filed for commands to trigger
  it is substituted for the full filename of the file being (un)installed

2006.07.28 Fri
{} syntax tested, updated man page, update/upgrade on our site
  simplified dphys-config.list using {}
packaged version 20060728.131953-1, changelog:
  "bugfix Server reachability tests, added {} feature"
for running triggered commands use  /bin/sh -c  instead of  eval
  saves user typing  /bin/sh -c  whenever an  if [ ]  is needed
  and also safer than with subshell, variables of script not damagable

2006.08.03 Thu
tested  /bin/sh -c
  noticed foo:/root: instead of foo:/root/: gives user-incomprehensible errors
    check for such user errors, warn user and auto-correct them
  updated man page to not have  /bin/sh -c ""  in its script test example
added -f option, to only run an filtered set of dphys-config.list lines
  saves time when just one/few config file(s) has been updated updated man page
packaged version 20060803.105525-1, changelog:
  "triggered command full shell without sh -c "", added -f filter option"
unified code for handling running external commands into run_command_safely ()
unified code for downloading/merging into fetch_and_merge_config_file ()
for variable amount and position of backtick/if/include
  brainstorming with heeb, only if first line #@dphys-config-preprocess ... ...
    with ... ... give selection and row of preprocessor modules to call
    this allows normal configfiles to stay unchanges, no accidents
      and per file user selecton how much needs to possibly be escaped
  `stuff` for substituting with stdout of an command, such as /bin/hostname
  #@if <condition> ; <line to insert>  for host specific, condition may be [ ]
  #@include extension to generalise host[pre|post]

2006.08.04 Fri
/bin/sh -c  code change has been distributed, simplify dphys-config.list
bug report, upgrade error on 30 of 150 hosts, CONFPLACE seems to be not set
  all of astro department (exept one) and just 2 others (and one special case)
    special case is most likely because having own dphys-config.list.hostpost
  upgraded "non-absolute place" from NOTE to WARNING, added log of it
  ensure that tests on CONFFILE_NAME and CONFPLACE defend against spaces
  debug run shows that  /bin/grep ${CONF_LINEFILTER}  is the culprint
    CONF_LINEFILTER set to .* for no filtering, and globbed after substitution
    so first filename in . becomes filter, rest files read instead of stdin
packaged version 20060804.112852-1, changelog:
  "bugfix CONF_LINEFILTER missglobbed screwing config list"
backtick/if/include preprocessor completed, extensive testing, works
  expanded man page with preproc options

2006.08.10 Thu
senguen Bugreport that dphys-config fails on newly install hosts
  config files do not get installed, downgrade to 20060728 version works
    both newer source restored on server, diffs, just small stuff, should work
  pomfrey upgraded again to 20060804, test, works, must be new install problem
  try new install 20060728 fails on config lines without  sh -c
    but only one warning, must have abborted before the second one
    is  /usr/sbin/install-keymap `/bin/cat /etc/install-keymap`  returns 128
      known bug, Debian Bug ID 339005, surfaced here because of  set -e
      20060804 version has  set +e  and  set -e  to combat such stuff
  new try, again gets 20060728, makesourcepackage -ui is failing to upload
    rsync produces error 23, but transfers, makesourcepackage -u transfers
    makelocalsite deletes 20060804 instead of 20060728, is file date
      20060728 has date of 0809 from restoring, so newer, 20060804 deleted
    delete 20060728 manually and reindex, try new install, works
  20060804 try shows abbort after first triggered script, is an missed edit
    exit 0 -> return 0, not return ${RETVAL} else script abborts after return
    works now as it should, all installed, but no output for - lines
      while here add missing message when running - lines to current
packaged version 20060810.132054-1, changelog:
  "bugfix  missed  exit 0  to  return 0  in run_triggered_commands ()"
further with preprocessor stuff testing, seems to work
old, not used any more, file sections remain in the cache
  need to be replaced on server by empty files, not deleted, error prone
    wget can not delete them after now getting 404
  when recieving an 404 delete the not fetched file, if existing
    but this fails because filename not known in  broken_net_wget_or_die ()
    and adding annother parameter makes code more bloated, less readable
  alternative get rid of caches version before fetching, or after installing
    or even at beginning all, or after run all, no cache at all, only spool|tmp
      has additional advantage of no need of copying over permissions to cache
    may produce more server load, but wget is doing 200 anyway, no cache effect
      and at roughly 1M of files per host not really relevant anyway
  removed all caching, deleted old cache directory
    now SYS_WORKDIR in /var/tmp, delete it at end of run
test run shows warnings in syslog, from non-zero return values
  own scripts add  exit 0  Debian stuff add  || /bin/true  to commands

2006.08.11 Fri
test if still warning output in syslog, none any more
  noticed dphys-config-* scripts log that they have run
    add option and code for doing this, so log shows that we run, as no own log
packaged version 20060811.111000-1, changelog:
  "preprocessor backticks/if/include, no cache"
added all previous "packaged version ????????.??????-?, changelog:" lines
  same also done to all other projects, consistent better docs
publish dphys-config-* scripts, added missing exit 0
  updated comments in script to use new {} and sh -c handling features
    dphys-config-quota added missing  set -e  and needed  || /bin/true
  copied all my scripts to SITE.example/local/sbin dir of dphys-config project
    and made in SITE.example an dphys-config.list and other files used by it

2006.08.17 Thu
index.html.en extended with all dphys-config-* scripts, and their config files
/etc/quota -> /etc/dphys-config-quota.list, config and script updated
Makefile copy SITE.example to /u/s/d/dphys-config/examples
dphys-config-usb-mouse merged into dphys-config-x, only if USB mouse used
  was already in, now just redundant old leftover, deleted
  dphys-config-x and dphys-config-filesys also log error messages into syslog
    while at it systematic adding of  exit 1  after all ERROR and FATAL
convert out site to using #@include instead of .host[pre|post]

2006.08.18 Fri
processing for #@include screws up when * in line, expands with directory
  same problem as with grep .*, checked up all ${} and added "" where needed
  while test run without preprocessor tags error processing
    #@dphys-config-preprocess line, fails because  cut -f 2-  no " ", broken
    checked up all  cut -f  and added tests for if needed data there
packaged version 20060818.153432-1 changelog:
  "bugfix ${} globbing * in data, bugfix  cut -f 2-  full line no delimitor"

2006.08.25 Fri
finished convertig our site to use #@include instead of .host[pre|post]
  remove .host[pre|post] feature for -2/3 server load and -1/2 runtime
  get rid of .merged suffix, use everywhere the remaining ex main file name
copy dphys-config.list to /etc, not just in /var/tmp, as that is now deleted
  allows better debugging of dphys-config.list generation, as it stays visible
when missing #@include file no NOTE: warning, annoys users, little value
packaged version 20060825.142020-1 changelog:
  "removed .host[pre|post] feature, dphys-config.list in /etc, no NOTE:"

2006.09.08 Fri
dphys-config.8 lintian man page warning fixed, \ before - because groff crap

2006.09.14 Thu
get ready for publication as an official Debian Linux ?.? (etch) package
  reworked and updated documentation, FAQ, INSTALL, README, index.html.en
  senguen wants to make own debian/* as lintian complains about native package
    looked into any information lost if deleting debian/* to avoid collision
  debian/changelog is all info duplicated in this Logfile, deleted it
  debian/control is just wget depends and docu text, add to other docs
    clearer in FAQ and man page, added to INSTALL and README
  debian/copyright is nearly same as in README, updated that
  debian/dphys-config.cron.d is simple example, move to main dir
    and removed debian/rules stuff  #@rc.d@ start 22 2 .
    add to Makefile installation into examples directory
  debian/dphys-config.docs is nothing, deleted it
  debian/dphys-config.init is simple example, move to main dir
    add to Makefile installation into examples directory
  debian/rules has nothing specific, deleted it
  while editing man page noticed that it still refers to .host[pre|post]
    update this to the new situation, partial rewrite, clarifications
    while editing noticed terminology used uninstall vs remove
      standardise on remove, and on postinstall and preremove, not postinst
  analog to all other *.example rename SITE.example to site.example
  as only producing an "upstream" and senguen doing "maintainer" version
    remove FAQ and INSTALL and index.html.en references to my old packages

2006.09.15 Fri
released 1st (and feature completed) milestone
  modified index.html and FAQ and INSTALL to show the milestone release
  no Debian packaging any more, senguen does this now, no changelog entry
  copy to ../dphys-config-20060915, made tar file of that
  remade ../dphys-config.tar.gz archive for current state
senguen while "upstream" packaging made suggestion move /usr/sbin to /usr/bin
  as it can also be used for distributing users dotfiles to multiple homes
  change all sbin to bin and also all man page .8 to .1
  add support for user configs ~/.dphys-config and ./dphys-config
  copy changes to milestone/release 1, make new tar of release

2006.09.21 Thu
make place for storing dphys-config.list to variable, so can be user writable
don't source ./dphys-config, danger of endless recursion, and near useless
  when user don't use /etc/dphys-config.list, go for ~/.dphys-config.list
Debian sid sed 4.1.5 newly fails caucious \{\}, because old basic regex style
  sarge sed 4.1.2. still processed \{\}, remove both \, now works on both

2006.10.05 Thu
index.html.en small text fixes, Link to official Debian package in Sid
more checking for potential escaping problems, aggressive use of ""
  all echo and CMD*PRINT* which have variables which may derive from user data
  for VAR in "${VARS}" ; do  fails, all ov VARS in one loop run
    so need to do this without "", so with tr filter ${VARS} only valid chars
  systematic rename to ${[SYS_]CONF[LIST|FILE][|_NAME|_URL|_PLACE]}
shrink space devoted to site.example in index.html.en, for more releases
update index.html.en and man page with what has changed since last release

2006.10.12 Thu
senguen porting to FreeBSD
  finds no /bin/gzip and /bin/true, has both in /usr/bin (urgh)
    we already set PATH, revise that, add /usr/local (for FreeBSD ports)
    after that remove all absolute paths to commands, not only from Code
      but also all example scripts, man page examples, Makefile
  /bin/sh has no keyword function, sh and bash work without it, drop it
    why does damn bash not warn of this, when running called as /bin/sh?
  /bin/sh also fails on "~/.xxx", has to be given ~/."xxx" to work

2006.10.13 Fri
after all bugfixes and changes new release
  updated FAQ, INSTALL, README, index.html.en
  copy to ../dphys-config-20061013, made tar file of that
  remade ../dphys-config.tar.gz archive for current state

2006.10.19 Thu
better automated test for missing "${VAR}", found one
  automated search for possible missed cases, sed /\\$/N trouble

2006.10.20 Fri
better automated test for missing "${VAR}", found annother one
  also replace ${TICK} processing with better, using set -e, prevent abbort
  while doing so found bug in #@if condition/line splitting, fixed
as only fetched by senguen, no distribution, redo 2nd release
  no dphys-config-20061013 any more, just dphys-config-20061020 as 2nd

as part of taking this over als personal project, after leaving job
  moved everything from www.phys.ethz.ch/~franklin to neil.franklin.ch website
    changes all URLs to refer to new home, expanded links to other projects
  we decided that I will keep on maintaining this project (and dphys-swapfile)
    as I also use these 2 projects at home on my own non-Debian systems

2007.06.12 Tue
added functioning (not wget based) support for file: URLs, corrected man page

2007.06.13 Wed
trying to use new functionality, fixed wrong  cut  specification in file: test

bugfixes for 2 reported bugs by Axel Beckert
  wget returns HTTP status code server dependant, sometimes ok instead of OK
    so filter out only the numeric code, do not use the textual message
  using "| while read LINE ; do" screws up spaces, processed as separators
    add IFS= before read, and also -r after read, prevent mutilations
    this reported 3 times in preprocessing, but also once in own input file

2009.05.18 Mon
Axel Beckert reports above bugfixes are OK
he is also from today on the new official Debian maintainer for dphys-config
  reported that the behavior fixed by above -r is reported Debian bug 510910
request for new feature, option set hostname, is not `hostname` inside chroot
  this chroot is used for installing xen guests/vhosts, also good for tests
  new option -c (configname) and config variable CONF_CONFNAME=`hostname`
    documented option in help, also both of them in man page
  while at it als drop deleting old tmp cache dir, no hosts with this any more
    and the system variable SYS_OLD_WORKDIR used only for it

2009.05.19 Tue
Axel Beckert reports bashism, usage of local, not Posix sh compatible
  and Lintian scan of man page finds 2 missed cases of - without using \-

2009.05.29 Fri
checked if other projects have local problem, only used that in dphys-config
  dphys-config chaged all  local VAR1=expr1 VAR2=expr2  to n*2 separate lines
    local VAR1; VAR1=expr; local VAR2; VAR2=expr2
dphys-config.1 .* at line begin problem, place an "any" before it
  and 2 cases of options beginning with - not escaped with \-
  but also more cases, not flagged, not options, but some - in commands
    in the end place an \ in front of every -, circumvent groff brokenness
    want all to be minus, and if hyphen desired anyway use \(hy
  this problem is in all dphys-* projects, is only an nuissance, not a bug
    lead others for the moment, fix whenever an project needs other fixes
dphys-config also added wish for SYS_WORKDIR using mktemp
  as commented out 2nd variant, no test, as in SYS_* section, keep it simple

2009.06.05 Fri
Axel Beckert tests and feedback
  suggested CONF_TMP_DIR for /var/tmp or /tmp, good idea, added it
    added also to dphys-config.example, while at it also added CONF_CONFNAME
    and updated man page with CONF_TMP_DIR
  suggested CONF_* option for PID or mktemp based workdir filename generation
    added also to dphys-config.example, and updated man page
    remove second variant of #SYS_WORKDIR=`mktemp ...` which requires user edit
      instead in code test for CONF_USE_MKTEMP=yes and then extend with mktemp

2009.06.27 Sat
Axel Beckert tests and feedback (ready for release, but with patches)
change mktemp switch to be automatic, use if present, no config option
  so now no need any more for an Debian patch to the option
  fixed in code (test with "which"), man page, and config example
suggested set CONF_BASEURL to use example.net domain, reserved for non-use
  is better so, no possibly valid (if unlikely) non-domain host name
  consistency then changed man page example from .example.org to .example.net
test for unset CONF_BASEURL and abort with explicit error message
  instead of aborting after many wget errors, and error msg only in servername
  allows Debian maintainer to drop his init.d and cron.d tests
    and these were only testing for presence of /etc/dphys-config anyway
    and so prevent him from installing an commented out example file
init.d example also use  > /dev/null 2>&1  like in cron.d example, consistant
  so that no error message, if not configured (possibly only used by users)
  also cron.d drop /usr/sbin like in init.d, also consistant
  updated man page with suggested variants and expanded explanations

2009.06.29 Mon
just while last testing a new bug report came
  one example script uses  echo -e  , yet annother bashism
  also then Axel Beckert discovered an  test -a/-o  , in other example
    did search, also found  test -a/-o  in main dphys-config script

2009.07.02 Thu
search for other  echo -e  usage
  in old (pre-)pkgtools Makefile, removed from makelocalsite, because bashism
  in older versions of swapfile, also removed, as not even used for anything
  many cases in dphys2, all versions, but that is woody-only, long dead
  so only active use remains this one case, change to get all correct
    no test host here or ETH, so no fix, change to #$/bin/bash, as only example
checkbashisms also disallows  echo -n  but debian accepts this
  used often, various init.d, makelocalsite, dphys-swapfile, dphys2, dphys3
  lots of work to change everywhere, if missing usually only visual effect
    correction either printf dependant (since when is this?) or allways visual
  so leave this the way it is, as standard practise, very old systems may fail
test -a/-o  also used in many projects, lots of work to change them all
  -a in d-c examp, dphys-kernel-packages (many), dphys-pkgtools, dphys2, dphys3
  -o in dphys-config, d-c example, dphys-pkgtools, dphys2, dphys3
  but dphys-config is only currently used stuff, only fix it here
    replaced  [ cond -o cond ]  with  ( [ cond ] || [ cond ] )  2+1 times
    replaced  [ cond -a cond ]  with  ( [ cond ] && [ cond ] )  2 times

2009.09.26 Sat
after all bugfixes and changes, and my holiday and Axels done, new release
  testing "current" 2 months showed no problems, no new Debian bug reports
  updated FAQ, INSTALL, index.html.en (incl Debian Maintainer name change)
  copy to ../dphys-config-20090926, change that Makefile, made tar file of that
  remade ../dphys-config.tar.gz archive for current state

2010.01.06 Wed
Axel Beckert reports new Lintian complains about 2 man page spellings
  one is according to Google used by 7.5% of writers, leave that
  the other is used by 2%, where leave/change threashold, 1% or 3%
  older historic language dispute case shown to be unter 0.1%, fix that
  used in multiple projects, but all others dead ones, only fixes here

2010.01.18 Mon
Axel Beckert reports Bug, reported by Guerkan Senguen
  parsing wget output fails if LANG= ist set and not to =C
    is fundamental wget brokenness, no reliable tests on exitcode possible
      curl as replacement ist not commonly installed, no 2 code variants
    so fix will be to set LANG=C before calling wget
      or better, catch potential other bugs, set it at beginning, for all
  also requests DEBUG_* for keeping (last) wget calls output file

2010.01.21 Thu
fix personal failled->failed spelling, as below 0.1% used variant
  used 8 times in dphys-config comments (2) and error messages (6)
    dont bother fix one use in site.example/local/sbin/dphys-config-x comment
fix personal usefull->usefull spelling, 2% is under "common" 3% threshold
  dphys-config (1), dphys-config.1 (3), index.html.en (5)
add/change LANG=C to/in main process environment, so wget also gets it
  reorganised set-e/PATH/LANG commenting to be one "setup" block
add new DEBUG_* option, keep (last) wget calls output file
  wget -o option is actually not stderr, rename file to @wget.output

2010.02.16 Tue
after all bugfixes and changes, and my holiday gone
  testing "current" 3.5 weeks showed no problems, no new bug reports
  updated FAQ, INSTALL, index.html.en (incl fixing some awkward HTML syntax)
  copy to ../dphys-config-20100216, change that Makefile, made tar file of that
