# this init.d script is intended to be run from rc2.d
#   on our site it needs to run after rc2.d/S20inetd (and so identd)
#     else our config file server will disallow requests for config files
#   on our site it needs to run before rc2.d/S24dphys-admin
#     else that will not find its /etc/dphys-admin.list config file
#   so we run it as rc2.d/S22dphys-config

# /usr/local added for FreeBSD, because their ports end up in there
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin

    # in case system was switched off for a while, no cron, run an upgrade

    # no direct output, so no on-screen error message if not configured
    #   this is also consistant with cron.d handling
    #   errors will still be recorded to syslog, enough, as not boot-critical
