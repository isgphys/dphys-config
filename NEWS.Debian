dphys-config (20090926-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The behaviour of dphys-config's init.d script and cronjob have been modified:

  * The init.d script does no more start dphys-config automatically inside
    a chrooted environment, because while the hostname in a chroot doesn't
    change, the configuration files you usually want, are different ones.

    This new behaviour make it possible to install the dphys-config
    package with debootstrap or xen-create-image from the xen-tools
    package in automatic installation setups without having to clean up
    the wrong config files from the newly created host.

    You can get back the old behaviour (don't check for chroots) by
    setting START_INSIDE_CHROOT="yes" in /etc/default/dphys-config.

  * Neither the init.d script nor the default cronjob start dphys-config
    automatically if no configuration file has been provided since the
    default values are set in a way that they can't work and the admin has
    to change them.

    This new behaviour prevents startup error messages if dphys-config has
    only been installed for the personal use of users, but not for the
    maintaining the configuration of the host on which it is being
    installed.
