Configuration
=============

1. ensure that wget is installed
2. install this software
3. make HTTP server space which will host the config files and file list
   (dir, HTTP server config, DNS, etc), such as http://server/configs/sarge/*
4. in the virtual servers base directory, make for each host an directory,
   such as http://server/configs/sarge/<hostname>/*
5. in this host directory put an file listing the files to be installed;
     with each line formatted: file-on-server:path-on-target:script-to-run
   as many hosts have the same files, hardlink or symlink them to an file in an
     http://server/configs/sarge/<PSEUDOHOST>/* directory
6. set up the config file /etc/dphys-config
   - where your file list and config files are to be found
7. run the /usr/bin/dphys-config script at every startup:
   - /usr/bin/dphys-config init
   and daily from cron:
   - 0 3 * * *  root  /usr/bin/dphys-config cron > /dev/null 2>&1
