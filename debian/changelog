dphys-config (20100216-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Works even with LANG not set to C or en_*
    - New debug option LEAVE_WGET_OUTPUT
    - Fixes some misspellings reported by Lintian 2.3.x
    - Other not so common spellings won't be fixed by upstream, so let's
      keep lintian quiet about them by using lintian overrides as
      suggested on the lintian mailing list.
  * Fix Lintian warning debhelper-but-no-misc-depends by adding
    ${misc:Depends} to the dependencies.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.4 (no changes)
  * Changed the maintainer e-mail address to my debian.org address.
  * [debian/init.d] Add dependency to $remote_fs due to usage of /usr.

dphys-config (20090926-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Now works with every web server (e.g. also ACME micro_httpd)
    - Now handles blanks and backslashes correctly while preprocessing
      and reading its own configuration file. (Closes: #510910)
    - Supports file:/// URLs for configuration file locations
    - Supports configurable temporary directory (defaults to /var/tmp)
    - Supports mktemp by default if available (also obsoletes mktemp fix
      from last NMU)
    - New option -c to override hostname in chrooted environments
    - Removed bashism fixes from last NMU since they have been intergrated
      by upstream even though Debian doesn't require them anymore since
      policy 3.8.1.
    - Some more bashisms fixed in example scripts plus some bashisms in
      dphys-config which checkbashism didn't find. (Closes: #530072)
    - Upstream updated man page to fix a bunch of lintian warnings.
    - Now throws error if ran unconfigured -> init.d script now also
      checks the existence of the mandatory CONF_BASEURL setting
  * New maintainer
  * Updated e-mail addresses and URLs of upstream website in
    debian/control and debian/copyright
  * Added Vcs-* headers.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.3
    - Changed all "(C)" to "©" in debian/copyright.
  * Changed dh_clean -k to dh_prep in debian/rules.
    - Bumped debhelper compatibility to 7.
  * Install upstream dphys-config.example as default /etc/dphys-config
    conffile.
  * Added a watch file.
  * Fixed lintian warnings:
    - debian-rules-ignores-make-clean-error
    - using-first-person-in-description
  * Define $(DESTDIR) in debian/rules for better readability
  * Changed behaviour of init.d script and cronjob:
    - init.d: Don't start automatically inside a chrooted
      environment. chrooted() test taken from udev.postinst.
    - init.d, cron.d: Don't start automatically if no config file has been
      created by the admin (prevents startup error messages if only
      installed for personal use of users).
  * Downgraded Recommends on pciutils to a Suggests.
  * Removed Recommends on tcc. (An example script often needed on Sarge
    needed tcc.)
  * init.d script and cronjob now do nothing if dphys-config has been
    removed but not purged. (Thanks to Myon for that hint!)
